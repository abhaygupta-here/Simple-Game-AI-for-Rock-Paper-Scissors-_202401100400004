# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

A simple implementation of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game where you play against an AI. The game follows the traditional rules:

- **Rock** beats **Scissors**.
- **Scissors** beats **Paper**.
- **Paper** beats **Rock**.
- If both players choose the same option, itâ€™s a tie.

This project is implemented in Python and is intended for fun and as an educational example to learn about basic Python concepts like functions, conditionals, loops, and random number generation.

## Features
